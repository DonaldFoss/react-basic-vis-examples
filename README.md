# react-basic-vis-examples
A few basic visualization examples that build on each other,
using [React](https://facebook.github.io/react/) and
[D3.js](http://d3js.org/). The project base
was generated using [Yeoman](http://yeoman.io/)'s [react-webpack generator](https://github.com/newtriks/generator-react-webpack).

**Demo** http://pbeshai.github.io/react-basic-vis-examples/

## Installation

Install npm packages

```npm install```


## Usage

Use grunt to start the web server

```grunt serve```

This will start the `webpack-dev-server` and open a browser to the locally running connect server.
